# DL-Image-SR
A deep-learning based project on upscaling low-resolution images to high-resolution while improving image quality and sharpness. Uses a SRGAN architecture with custom modifications to improve generated image fidelity and sharpness by using the detected edges in the input image via a high-pass filter.
